# Spiking Neurons as Data-Driven Controllers of LTI Systems
Inspired by [The Neuron as a Direct Data-Driven Controller](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2311893121), this repository presents an implementation of a Spiking Data-Driven Controller for control of Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) systems. The controller is based on the data-driven design framework, which has gained significant attention in recent years, as exemplified by [Data-Enabled Predictive Control: In the Shallows of the DeePC](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8795639). Based on behavioral systems theory, data-driven methods operate directly on *trajectories* rather than specific system representations like state-space or transfer function models. Bypassing the traditional modeling step, these methods enable control or simulation directly based on measured input-output data. Data-driven methods are typically expressed in terms of large data matrices containing input-output trajectories of the system. This implementation reformulates a data-driven predictor in terms of fixed-size covariance matrices. The covariance estimates can be updated recursively as new input-output data is collected through interaction with the system, enabling online learning and adaptation without growing data matrices. 

The neuron is modelled as a data-driven receding horizon predictor of the next outputs of the plant. Two covariance matrices are used to express an optimal least-squares linear predictor of future plant outputs given the planned control input and a short history of past inputs and outputs. The spiking rule is inspired by the framework of [Spiking Neurons as Predictive Controllers of Linear Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16495). It relies on two predictions of the future plant outputs: (i) assuming that the neuron does not spike, and (ii) assuming that the neuron spikes. Quadratic costs are assigned to both predictions based on the deviation from a reference signal, with an additional cost associated with firing a spike. The neuron spikes if the prediction with a spike yields a lower total cost than the non-spiking prediction. 

The control signal from the neuron is an impulse delivered to the plant when the neuron spikes. The strength of the impulse is fixed, and hence at least two neurons with opposite spike signs are needed to deliver both positive and negative control actions. It is observed that greater control performance is achieved when the neurons receive spikes from other neurons as input in addition to the plant output, i.e., when the neurons are connected in a network. Performance is also observed to improve with more than the bare minimum of two neurons in the network.

## Results
To illustrate the performance of the Spiking Data-Driven Controller we consider control of a simple spring-mass-damper system using a fully connected network of spiking neurons. As illustrated below, each neuron receives the plant output (the mass position) as well as the spikes from all other neurons in the network as inputs. The input to the plant is the sum of the spikes from all neurons in the network, where half of the neurons deliver positive impulses and the other half deliver negative impulses.

Using a network of eight spiking neurons, the system is able to accurately track a reference signal, as shown below. The left figure shows the mass position tracking the reference signal over time, with spikes from the eight neurons shown in the raster plot below. The right figure gives a zoomed-in view. Note that at the start of the simulation the neurons have no prior knowledge of the dynamics, but adapt to control the plant within a few seconds of interaction.

## Final Remarks
This implementation demonstrates a data-driven spiking controller for LTI systems. Each neuron is represented as a data-driven predictor of the LTI system, and acts as both a sensory and motor neuron simultaneously. Receiving the plant outputs and applying control directly to the plant, the neuron can predict the causal effect of its own spikes on the plant behaviour. This enables control of the plant by estimating the advantage of spiking compared to not spiking, as measured by a reference-tracking objective. 

Contrasting this work, typical artificial neural networks have more than a single layer, meaning the majority of neurons neither directly measure nor directly control the plant. Such a system blurs the typical control-theoretic distinction between the *controller* and the *plant*. From the neuron-as-a-controller perspective, the *external system* seen by an individual neuron, consists of both other neurons and the plant. It cannot distinguish the internal network dynamics from the external plant dynamics, and its task must be to optimize their joint behaviour. Considering the network as the *controller*, this emphasizes the problem of optimizing the internal dynamics of the controller rather than exclusively focusing on controlling the plant behaviour.

Future work aims at investigating event-based data-driven control methods for optimizing the internal dynamics of spiking neural networks to enable control of an external system. 


## Usage
To run the simulation, execute the `run.py` script after installing the required dependencies. The simulation parameters are specified in a configuration file in YAML format. Configuration files for two, four, and eight neurons are provided in the repository, and can be adapted as desired.
